# Pro-Quality Of Life

Banning abortion is against the quality of life, it forces parents to raise a child in a way that is unprepared for the world. Whether or not someone is sex positive doesn't matter, creating a child that is ready to endure the world ensures a life without suffering.
Otherwise a world where a child is forced to live just to avoid abortion causes a higher likelihood of parents that aren't ready to raise a child, and increases the likelihood of a child living an entire life as unwanted by it's parents.
This would guarantee a child a lifetime of neglect and rejection, and financial abandon.
This is why I am not a pro-lifer it is incidentally short sighted...

I am pro-quality of life, which focuses on all child birth being by parents that are ready and able to have a child, thus ensuring it's health, happiness, and success in the world.
All markers that a child will go without conscious abuse from its environment.
See making sure the parents are behind the child in choice is important to ensuring a life without cruelty to the children...
A cruelty most pro-lifers would choose for a child.

All children are the products that create the entire next generation of a world, our next glimpse of hope at the world's horizons...
Ensuring they children have the best is dependent on making sure the parents are ready to raise a child to the best of their abilities. Otherwise a house full of neglect and poor parenting awaits the children of a pro-life minded society ironically.
We must be pro-quality of life at all costs to ensure all the children within our generation are the outcome of the most happiness the world can provide...
The children deserve it, as much as the world needs it.

To a world overflowing with happy children in all their innocence!
