# Love

If the way our mind functions can cause us to repress parts of the self if not accepted,
Then the true understated healing power of the notion 

"True Love is acceptance, not judgement"
It would scientifically prove the only way to anoint someone's heart first is to make sure you've worked your way past parts of the repressed self, and the only way there is through acceptance.
This is why the concept of judgement is a failing one, since you cannot even excavate a behavior without accepting it first... Acceptance as an act of love is the only way the mind can perceive the source of all behaviors, and thus actually know how to heal them. Hence the saying "from darkness into light", and vice versa.

On the other hand, acting from a place of God's judgement just represses and bottles these evils up under pressure... while also neglecting to understand the real source of the behavior itself, the only way to truly defeat it forever.
See if the mind is fighting something it naturally doesn't want to understand it, and love & acceptance is the only true way to defeat evil across all of humanity.
The deeper reasoning behind the power of the saying,

"True love is acceptance, not judgement."

So be mindful of the groups that use judgement as a means to an end...
They blindly create the evils of this world through rejection of the self,
rather than a true acceptance and knowing of your self, shared with all.
