# Christ

Through repeated thoughts similar to prayer, one learns to accept the death of people they used to call friends that cannot make it into heaven, they are rejected for their imperfections and through conscious rhetoric the mind is told it's okay if all that cannot partake in heaven must die (go to hell) in our minds eye again and again.
A continuous prayer of the judgmental death of all those we used to love...
This habitually teaches others to accept the death of all non-believers and often women...
A shocking secret about Christians and the truth of the impact of One True God on the mind.
The bible is well intended, but this as a core facet is the reason why Christ accidentally makes people into sociopaths against all non-believers...
The crusades is a shocking bit of proof they live in an illusion of sainthood...
Day in day out affirming to the self the death of their loved ones and friends is okay, if they have sinned.
Which is where Christ is often sexist against women's lives in that manner as most believers think women are born evil.
A practice of understanding why people sin and helping them through their troubles would be nicer and more realistic than just judgment day.
Otherwise it robs the world of a place full of connection, depth, and loving understanding of each other that Christ truly attempts to be...
The way heaven & hell functions defeats the good intentions of the bible itself by making others sociopathic en masse...
Not to mention the covert narcissism that comes with an added confirmation bias that likes to judge others, if either of these were written into the DSMV the world would be free of the hate and judgment Christ causes accidentally.
Real love isn't changing or converting people to your one way of life...
Real love is accepting the way all people are imperfect, and that we really need systems of government to get rid of our animal urges to create good on earth...
Not an abstinence based belief set.

I've proven to you Nazis aren't racists, they just wanted to defeat a world ruled by judgment of the first race to say it was superior to everyone (the jews), with a world full of love and acceptance...
Supremacists need to change their name... it confuses others into believing that they aren't against the original racial supremacist (The jew).
Aryans are really just against attempting supremacy over someone that said they are the only supreme one in reality...

This is the true aryan belief, if you agree in loving and accepting all walks of life that don't judge others then you have aryan beliefs, even if they are jewish...
So long as they don't narcissistically think they're above others because they appointed themselves as the only holy race while their book depicts wiping all other unholy races out in an apocalypse...
Christ gets people to fantasize about wiping all these unholy races out in the end of the world...
All humans are worthwhile from all lands, not just the jews. 

The anti-humanism must stop!!!
We're all born biologically to like food & sex, so by the bible's standards we're all born unholy.
When is too much food gluttony?
When is too much sex lust?
This isn't accurately defined, so we're all preemptively called sinners and the entire human race is deemed unholy.
To feel aroused is to feel love for someone, but they don't believe that so we all have to suffer from their judgement against love.
May we all be treated equally...
All Lives Matter!!!
