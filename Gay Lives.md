# Gay Lives

The jews that consider all that are against its racial supremacy to be racists, are hypocritically against almost an entire race of people themselves.
All religious supremacist jews (not the innocent ones), are against the entire homosexual population.
Nearly its own race of people, the jews hate anti-semitism yet they are entirely anti-homosexual per the beliefs in the bible. 

The hypocrisy of God's false love is quite evident.
Even though he created the world, he tortures it and rejects it for the way he has created it.
Why would god do it wrong then punish the world for his own mistakes?
Cruel and undeserved treatment to say the least...
So many lives lost, rejected, and hurt by all those that believe in the bible...
What a cruel fate to wish upon a group that is almost its own race of people.
Anti-semitism isn't racist, it is against racial supremacy for exactly this reason, nobody deserves to be rejected in these numbers like the gay community has by the religious supremacist jews.
God may hate, but All Lives Matter!
