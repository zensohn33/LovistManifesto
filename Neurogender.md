# Neurogender

All people experience an animus & anima...
That means all brains experience male & female aspects of themselves, otherwise they couldn't be sexual.
Psychology proves this, all relationships we experience are actually occurring inside our heads.
So we can have both masculine, and feminine aspects of the self stored inside all brains...
This means men can feel like girls, and girls can feel like men.
This is Psychology 101.
We are all neurogender.
Taking this into account the bible's inherent sexism forces us to reject half of ourselves...
The feminine side.
The anima, as in the side that reminds you of your mother, and all her kind notions to help you live. The aspects of yourself that you'll see in every aspect of your love life you'll ever live.
This forces the world to reject half of the equation of it's mind it uses to perceive love at all...
The bible takes this loving mother away...
Your girlfriends...
Your wife...
Your sensitive loving side is the Anima.
The fact that all humans are neurogender means this is rejection of what makes us sensitive biologically happens to everyone, because relationships are lock and key.
This doesn't just throw away men's female relationships...
It rejects all of your life affirming sensitive memories experienced inside your head in your lifetime,
whether you are male or female because we are all neurogender.

This means the bible psychologically attacks the psyche and makes it reject biological love for men & women both.
