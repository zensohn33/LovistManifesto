# ChurchWashing

Due to constraining what is permissible to do, religious supremacists inhibit love's true expression globally... If it doesn't fit the choir silently it becomes rejected.
Due to having a socially selected theme, and the notion of One True God...
All must follow one way.
Love in all it's forms is being restricted to what the church deems that god says is permissible to be as a human being only.
And what god says is debatable from person to person, yet never to be disputed...
Blindly starving the masses.
See if they don't feel it's ok to express,
then it restricts the people from loving someone for it.
Thus religious supremacists kill the world's love daily with control.

The true missed intention of religious supremacy is love.
God's intention is love, yet God kills love daily worldwide.
All the missing representations of humanity that aren't allowed by the church's sense of taste, and are thus 90% of the world's diversity is annihilated from humanity by means of selection...
One True God kills this diversity in humanity and the beauty of the earth's pluralism.

Silently suffocating all walks of life into what is allowed in a church...
Disallowing an accepted imperfect love in oneself...
Crippling your mind if you're less than perfect...
And if you don't fit the churches sense of perfection, you will live the rest of your life as a reject.
The church inhibits love & free expression, rejecting all the world's colors into a blinding white...

Where is the diversity of love?

And isn't the only thing that stands in the absence of love... hate?
A silent hate remains...
God's silent judgement.
