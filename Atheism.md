# Atheism

All things considered in these writings, a modern humanist's perspective on being without god is illuminating and enlightening. Giving up homophobia, adopting a new stance on feminism, and defining how our bodies are biologically dependent on our actions to maintain our psycheâ€™s sense of love...

This all shows signs of a emotional draught on religion's side, and an exciting new era of love to be perceived and enjoyed due to atheism.
From the buddhist,
From the witch,
Atheism has grown into the new era of consciousness.
Ironically science was seen as cold and removed, rather than religion being that way as proven by science. 

Funny how the mind perceives things.
Now in all reality Nazism is in line with modern atheism, to reject god for various reasons, it just so happens a lot of those reasons are in line with civil rights...

Same sex marriage,
Abortion rights,
and Gender Equality.
Not to mention that slavery was supported by the religious commonly, a form of classism.

To have a fake god reject someone's prayers in silence as they plead to be saved isn't something I want to see my fellow humans have to endure.
I'd rather be an honest individual that says no, talking to yourself won't save your life.
To save someone's life from a lie.
This is the modern humanist's agenda for atheism,
Yes we die when we get old...
But without the urgency of perceiving mortality we waste our lives.

Let the truth reveal all, and science guided by it.
Who knows how many lives atheism saves...
Just being able to think for yourself, rather than being dependent on a false god...
Can save your life.
You only live once.
