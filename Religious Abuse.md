# Religious Abuse

No objectively defined set of quantifiable margins of what and when a sin occurs exists to date...
This opens the field for how easy it is to say someone is a sinner, which can be traumatizing since it involves life & death ideation.

All those in relations with the religious are victim to this form of abuse.
For instance the range of the sin of Lust can range from merely glancing at someone, to watching pornography.
This leaves such a wide room for interpretation of sin that it allows all the religious to have a wide field to damn someone with. 

A form of psychological abuse.

This occurs from the confusion and fear for life out of attempts to analyze one's sins, since fearing hell is fearing death and death is extreme enough to cause traumas.
Religious self confirmation can lead to extreme psychological damages including but not limited to:

PTSD,
Confusion,
Memory loss,
Emotional Instability,
Depression/Helplessness,
and
Low self-esteem.

These are some of the damaging effects of all the sins being so open to interpretation to all socially involved with the religious. This process only goes to fuel the validity and self confirmation of religious practitioners.
The process of religious gaslighting is as simple as someone repeating that someone has sinned, and causes the damages listed above and potentially more.
Anyone can retain traumas from being told they are a sinner, since a fear of death/hell is easily traumatic.
Religion is easily traumatic to all involved and widespread in its reach due to its seemingly kind intentions.
The religious abuse only continues to fuel the validity of the religious narcissist and strengthens abuse. Abuse from religious narcissism can cause a lifetime of these symptoms:

Problems forming healthy relationships,
Low self-worth,
Anxiety,
Lessened empathy for others,
Depression,
PTSD,
Emotional numbness,
Emotional dysfunction,
and
Suicidal ideation.

Due to the commonality of these two forms of abuse a high percentage of the population is effected worldwide from religion and the symptoms of the either form of abuse can last a lifetime.
Most let the abuse continue because they are unaware of these effects as they happen, or they think religion is innocent in effect.
Most are wrong.
