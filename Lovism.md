# Lovism

Lovist:
Someone who believes that without the confines of religion you can feel more love for people.

"The religious people had a limited view of what you they thought is acceptable to love, even though that's all they seemed to say they study in their religion, what they thought was acceptable was so limited they barely love anyone" said the lovist.

When our bodies experience a real love that is balanced equally through gender equality then, this unlocks our deeper capacity to save the world with our love.
This love follows us with everything we do in our life, and it depends on our biological actions to maintain it and express it.
The Lovism's perspective is that science proves the need of gender equality unlike the bible...

Lovism actually produces a stronger love than Christ's biologically due to it’s gender equality.

It makes love twice as bioavailable.
Buddha has his own agenda and sometimes the realest love looks ugly.
Christians often find real love "gross" or "disgusting" or "distasteful".

That is the deep importance of overcoming the ego.
Romanticizing our ideation with beautiful wings,
Compared to sharing the ugly truth of love as beautiful...
Romanticizing love is the death of love, because love isn't beautiful sometimes at it's realest.
Only when the world realizes this truth and accepts it the world's experience of love will be deeper.

The final frontier for a lovist, part of the Neo Aryan movement.
Distributing the deepest realizations of love in it's most powerful form to the world…
