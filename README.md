A modern view of the deeper potential of atheism towards one's capacity to love, and what this means for the future of humanity.
Taking a look at the biological discrimination that most churches sugar coat and distribute to the world en masse through their daily habits.
All leading toward the deep realization that just because something doesn't advertise itself as "loving" doesn't mean it isn't in reality.
Atheism manages to avoid homophobia, sexism, and other forms of silent judgement towards others...
Contrary to many people labeling it as "disconnected from the heart" or cold or logical...
This proves the secret life of atheism actually provides more love than Christ...
Hence the title: Lovist's Manifesto

(A lovist is part of a gender equality movement that believes atheism provides more love than Christ. 
since the Bible rejects women's livelihoods in the millions daily. Not to mention the bible has supported homophobia as most know, 
and that the bible was even to be held responsible for slave owners thinking god had given them the right to african american slaves.
For many the effects of the bible and the classism of One "True" God is seen as damaging to the world as it really is for once.)
