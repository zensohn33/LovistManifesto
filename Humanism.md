# Humanism

Humanism is a philosophical and cultural movement that emphasizes the inherent value, dignity, and potential of all human beings.

 It originated during the Renaissance in Europe, but its roots can be traced back to classical antiquity. Humanism centers on human experience, reason, and ethical values, often in contrast to religious or supernatural beliefs that you are inferior without being a believer. This makes the religious lack empathy toward others while trying to “save” them. 

Also God places authority outside of human agency. It is the fact that God is placed outside of agency that creates the evils of God.

 Milgram would say this makes someone sociopathic for the Bible due to its concepts of heaven & hell hijacking the mind away from social reality… Causing many forms of internal judgment/hate against others including sexism, homophobia, and biological discrimination via “sins”.

 Since prominent aspects of the bible deny humanity critical portions of our basic needs, humanism is taking a stand against these inequities, and stands to ensure all lives have their basic needs met, and never denied.

A critical component of the Neo Aryan movement.

Many may disagree with this notion because they are fooled by the aesthetic forms represented by the bible, and aren’t yet privy to how the rejection of basic human needs as “sins” is extremely detrimental to the wellbeing of all humanity… And it spreads like plague under angel wings. 

Proof you cannot judge reality by its appearance, and that as human beings it is our duty to ensure the happiness and wellbeing of all with the investigation of reality and its pieces. 

Another massive facet of humanism, is the common belief that humanity is good overall… This means to have faith in one another is why humanity doesn’t need saving religiously. Seeing the overall good in humanity creates it by believing in one another… That's how Humanism takes a stand against humanity being deemed inferior til we're “saved”.

Love connects us all, and we are all born with it… Whether the religious can see it or not.
