# The Flood

Antisemitism is caused by the flood in the bible that wipes the world out to start it anew,
And the fear others have that if they're not Christian that they'll be slaughtered in the apocalypse. Considering One True God is their slogan of sorts this is something to fear.

In order to stop antisemitism the Christian hate from the rapture must end, or the world will be forced to protect itself from an angel with standards so high it makes all evil.
One True God causes this...
Giving it up starts world peace.
Tolerating other lives besides your own One True Belief is a critical aspect of life Christian's and Jews alike could learn. If you fool yourself into thinking loving people from outside your religion is wrong due to it being idolatry, or that they're "not good enough for you"
that is intolerance, and discriminatory.
It isn't idolatry, it's seeing the good in races different than you...

I don't blame you for being born different Israel,
But murdering the world from loneliness is not angelic,
Save your people's lives by giving up the hatred of your judgement day.
Because murdering the world is against the commandments...
Just because it was prophetic, doesn't mean you're allowed to break the commandments.

Cry if you need to...
An angel that broke the commandments is no angel at all.
Definitely lost and full of hate.
If you want antisemitism to stop, make a new bible that focuses only on the goodness of people, not their sins.
After all, we become what we focus on.

Also find why a lot of believers don't follow the rules...
The crusades were enacted by massive believers,
Why don't they follow their own rules?

Stop the judgement from judgement day if you don't want to be judged.
Be the change you wish to see in the world.

Write a new book that focuses on the virtue in us all.
One True God and conversions stops Christ's tolerance of others...
Please take this seriously...
The reason you want to break the commandments, and have in the crusades...
Is the conquest of One True God...
When Christ accepts those without a path then the world will be at peace finally.
You can only teach the willing without losing your heart to narcissism...
All man is inherently good, and knowing this manifests it into reality.
Share this with all...

The flood of the earth is losing your way to breaking the commandments.
Save Israel by helping others give up the hate...
See all of mankind's good intentions then your life will know infinite freedom.

The pursuit of one true god against all is the exact grain of sand that causes angels to defy the bible itself.
It isn't idolatry, it's seeing the inherent good in all walks of humanity.
Allow others to be good from different religions, Christ please see the good outside your own people...
It isn't idolatry,
It will save your people.
The effects of converting and one true god is what causes all believer's narcissistic personality disorder and to defy the commandments...
Stopping this gives your people a clean slate on earth to save everyone with.
Defeating the evil effects of self confirmation saves all your kind intentions.

Giving up One True God, and the Apocalypse saves the people of Israel from the conceptual backfire of all the good intentions of One True God.

Stagnancy is rot...
Give up the smell of death that One True God causes, and let buddha be sitting with you at the dawn of a new day.
