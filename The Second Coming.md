# The Second Coming

Since Christ is an effeminate man, and the inherent sexism and homophobia rejects femininity as "sinful", I don't believe in the second coming of Christ.
He was depicted as an effeminate man with long hair, yet psychologically the bible makes men reject their anima, due to the "sinful" nature of eve.
This is what I mean by religious sexism.
The anima is the source of love itself for a man.
Due to the mismatch in depictions of how Christ should be, and what the bible creates...
I don't believe the masses will find a gentle caring effeminate man, rather most are harsh and authoritative and judgemental. If those are the ones seeking to be the second coming I don't believe it will happen because of religious sexism, and the rejection of the anima.
The keys to world peace and finding Christ are hidden in an effeminate nature...
That which the sexism of the bible doesn't provide.
Eve...
Mary...
Why are you hidden?
When will you be an equal to Christ?
Those words should be heard more,
"Holy Mother"
It Unlocks the capacity for the real Christ to even emerge.
