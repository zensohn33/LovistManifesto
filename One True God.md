# One True God

If you really deeply observe the meaning of the words One True God, you'll realize something startling... The creators of this term are against what everyone else thinks as a way of life...

The origins of religious supremacy as an act of classism against the world. All religions are included in the list that Christians are against besides their own, this is what One True God means...
A Christian is someone that narcissistically believes only their way of life is functional, and has acted to exterminate millions of non-believers worldwide in the crusades... contrary to what the commandments say.
This is religious narcissism, religious supremacy, and for Jewish Christians a way of saying your race is above all others... Racial supremacy. 

If the concept of One True God wasn't true... it would be just innocent religious acts...
But they are in a competition against everyone else.
The same type of thought that made eugenics appear racist, is the exact same type of thinking to say their race was superior to others... It's said in an innocent wording "Holy Race"
But considering it is intolerant towards other's beliefs and wants everyone to be the same under One True God, it isn't innocent at all.

They aim to change diversity, rather than accept it.
And this is the heart of love, acceptance.
Only hate needs to change things.
Not to mention this race not only says it is superior, but distributes beliefs that tear down what 99% of the world does naturally as "evil".
I personally believe most men are born good in nature due to the fact that we all feel love.
We've  tried to compete with their narcissism and got dismissed as racist for years because of their attempt to fight the narcissism of the self titled holy race that wants to set the world aflame in the rapture with the death of all not like them...
That is the strongest narcissism we've seen a race exhibit, most allow at least the freedom for others to believe as they wish...
But not the conquest of One True God against all who don't follow its sexist, homophobic, and outdated ways...
One True God doesn't have faith in others, otherwise it wouldn't be converting.
Don't let the light deceive you into its actual darkness.
One True God against all, or a world free to believe in all beliefs?

One True God is the death of diversity in this world...
One way or else...
Not all ways, for all...
