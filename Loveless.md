# Loveless

Below is defined how the bible makes someone evil, and actually causes them to reject love biologically.

The biological interpretation of love itself depends on the opposite sex in the mind.
If it is incidentally deemed a "sin" to perceive the anima (the opposite sex),
the source of all love itself...

Then Love itself is deemed a sin by Eve's behaviors in the garden of eden.
The scientific truth of the bible is that it closes off the perception of love biologically...
Neurologically banned from experiencing real biological love, while a story of love plays on a flickering screen that actually revolves around the judgement of sins.
The sin of eve, is biologically the root of Christian evils, since it rejects love itself via sexism.
Christ is made of love, yet the book makes you reject love biologically.
The scientific proof that the bible is a story that fools you into feeling love, while biologically it makes you reject love.

Darkness, from light.

p.s.
When someone calls themselves a sinner, it's just their subconscious fighting for the existence of love itself.
This is proven by basic psychology.
If something is a "sin" it is rejected by life & death ideation.
This is how the bible grabs hold of the neural cortex assigned to life & death ideation,
The paleo-cortex, with the ideas of Heaven & Hell (Life & Death).
Thats where the mind is dominated into a false love.
Meanwhile biologically it severs the part of your cognition associated with motherly love, the Anima.
It does this through life & death ideation and sexism combined, through the story of the original sin.

If you are sympathetic to the bible it is most likely due to your brain being hijacked by it's life and death ideation. (Heaven & Hell)
The biological reality is Loveless and sexist.
A cry for the scientific revolution of our live's reality to come to light, without science, books like the bible can make us abandon our love by tricking the brain into a false love...

Love's biological existence is always the beginning of a memory.
Never let it falter.
