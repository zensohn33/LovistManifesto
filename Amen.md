# Amen

Taking into consideration that the sexism of the bible is very different biologically, since it disconnects the mind from the Anima for men.
The reality of this is a startling one, a man that can't perceive the feminine side of his self because it is a sin... becomes not only sexist, but loveless.

If your opposite sex is rejected from being deemed as life or death to do so by the body,
(as sins do)
Then it isn't far to show you verbal proof this is happening...

A freudian slip exists in the spelling of the word amen.
it's pronounced A-Men as in a sexist reference to men only.
Psychological proof of the effects of the sexism that lies in the bible, right in the most commonly used word of the church lies its sexism.
Not just sexism, but a psychological rejection of love itself.
it's spelled A-M-E-N.
Thanks Freud for showing me these so called angels are actually spreading a thought virus, that gets people to reject love biologically.
All the while, those who love are being damned to death as sinners by the church.
Imagine the hurt of rejection of those just trying to love.
And to think all these concepts were previously mislabeled as racist...

Contrary to their opposition being sexist, homophobic, and biologically loveless…

Oh the irony…
