# The Desert

A people really made for the extreme conditions of the desert, Israelites.
Made to abstain from all things in life to survive. Not good nor bad, that's just what environment they were made for, the desert. An area of the world so devoid of life that the central figure of their religion fasts.

Yet in a world full of resources, and the fact that abstaining from resources/behaviors makes people irritable if they aren't from the Desert, this means their ideology is only suited for their own DNA.
Since really thats all the religion is, an evolutionary behavioral attempt at survival that revolves around fasting in the desert.
Since the religion was an attempt at survival in a desert, I would say it is behaviorally unfit for most people in places that don't need to abstain from sustenance.

Not to mention in studies fasting is shown to increase aggression, contrary to the point of a religion. Perhaps why the bible is full of violent sacrifices and other violence.
Because the beliefs are based around fasting behaviors, they are inherently violent, contrary to how they seem.

The human body outside of a desert isn't made for fasting/abstaining from daily pleasures, especially just because someone from a lifeless desert wants you to join in their experience of a lifeless life...

People are made for different things, but the world is a beautiful place full of discoveries made to be enjoyed, not abstained from. We have different diets/behavioral needs than those pushed on the world by desert DNA.
Especially when its proven by Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs that having our physical needs met actually makes us at peace within ourselves and reveals the deeper self, contrary to fasting/abstinence based beliefs.

So don't get lead away from your peace!
