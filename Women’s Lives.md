# Womenâ€™s Lives

The church incidentally became male dominant, contrary to the fact women are physiologically made for peace (raising children), compared to men which are born to hunt (violence).
This inherent preferential sexism is anatomically unacceptable since peace is a feminine thing biologically.
It's against the peace religion attempts to be.
A religious contradiction.
Seeing as Israel has been at war with itself for 14 centuries, the implications of this inherent sexism toward masculinity is even more curious.
Women are born biologically geared toward peace, not sinners that should die in hell.

The scientific truth of peace is that it comes from women, and nations that shun their women cannot create peace. This is the inherent violence of the bible due to rejecting women in our biology we become violent, contrary to what christ strives to be...
The objective truth is that we cannot reject women in our psyches or we become lost and hateful, as Israel has done.
We need science to create peace, not someone that rejects femininity without knowing it's deeply rooted place in the biological creation of peace.
The fact is that religion is hateful toward the ingredients needed to create world peace, and Gaza has been divided for centuries...
This is no coincidence...
Mary, why are you hidden?
The secret to world peace is hidden within her alone.
