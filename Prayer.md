# Prayer

Repeating things to our minds makes us believe them, the greeks used it often.
It's called rhetoric.
See the act of prayer is an act of repetition, which can lead the mind astray...
Say we repeated daily that we were the solution to the world's problems...
No matter the true answer, repetition would make us believe that we are right.
This is insanity.
Prayer is so strong it could hide sin, depending on the number of times it is done.
The crusades happened regardless of the commandments...

To see the true essence of reality for all it is, that is the only way to create a real lasting happiness for all.
Sadly prayer puts out that flame with a contamination of our own beliefs, contrary to the reality all our peoples that need saving live within...
The only way toward finding the path to their actual happiness.
Prayer obscures this happiness, with a shroud of false positivity, drowning any chances of real happiness.

The only way left to true happiness for the masses is silent...
Shapeless in all its love, fighting darkness that thinks it is the light.
