# Not racism

The reason the aryan race was created from a socialist's point of view is this:
The jewish race and its racial supremacy (One “True” God) was set to put an idealogical monopolization on the whole of the world, thus wiping out all free thinking diversity with their One "True" God.

Antisemitism wasn't racism, it was against racial and religious supremacy rotten with religious abuse and a world ending apocalyptic ideation.
A race that said it is better than everyone else (Holy race) that fantasizes about jihads against all the unholy races (the rest of humanity, this is the Jewish anti-humanism)
It was just competing to be the winning holy race with a racial supremacist that made aryans appear racist against non-racial supremacists.

Remember a socialist is against classism in society it says so in the definition of a socialist.
That nobody should be superior or inferior... That we may all be equal amongst classes and the races contained.
Matter of fact the name Nazi actually is derived from the words "National" and "Socialist", we thought this would make it clear that eugenics was only a scoreboard to compete on, not racism against any others since socialists are against classism, contrary to the way ranking in eugenics appeared.

So if you've mislabeled Nazis as racists, you quite simply haven't read the name tag's definition, in the word nazi. Being against classism isn't racist it's the opposite. It's a cry for equality amongst classes (races).
I believe eugenics was misinterpreted by most intelligence officers as racism, rather than an attempt at taking down the original racial supremacists...

This is countering racial supremacy, not racism.

If someone stomps their feet down and says obey their nation or else, to not hate means to have your freedom of belief destroyed... Something that a nation who converts people doesn't care about. They killed witches for believing something else......
So this puts us in a position, to find the freedom to think for myself or get indoctrinated.
No religion should state that it's people are superior to anyone under "One True God", especially when it has fatal ideation against others not of its beliefs, contrary to the commandments.
Expecting everyone to succumb to one way of thought is unacceptable, it's the death of diversity.

It's a powerful thing for one nation to control the way 99% of the world's thoughts would work, and we believed in a fight that was against that, and slavery is only one aspect of what classism from religion can do. 

We had to take the fight to remove this religious supremacy created from the notion of One True God, the people should be free to think in and believe all things, not just one nation's way of thought, especially when it has a confirmation bias.

See, the only way justice wins in the world, is through idealogical diversity.
If any one way of thought should hold the world captive against its will, justice vanishes because our diversity of thought dies.
If you believe in idealogical diversity, and the free thinking potential of the world as a whole...
Then you have Neo Aryan beliefs.

The whole reason the original aryans were created as a race was to counterbalance the corrupting forces of a racial supremacist people that only believe in their own way of thought should win against the diversity of the world's colors and their freedom to think.
There is no one "true" way, 

Just diversity & freedom seeking the next challenge.
