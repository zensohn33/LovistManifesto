# Devil

Anything associated with the devil is actually proven to be subconscious aspects of love itself.

People running from the church to 

"devil worship"...
are actually subconsciously in fear of losing their freedom to express love.
The Anima (femininity), is psychologically associated with the devil.
So visions of the opposite sex are reported, and tales of sexuality...
Standard human behavior as any psychologist will tell you.
Sex is what makes tomorrow true to human consciousness.
The deepest cries of our subconscious mind to keep love alive are some of the guiding forces behind our sexuality and is something the bible fights actively.

Intuitively we knew that something was wrong with someone calling "love" something to be associated with the Devil (evil).

And they spread these loveless beliefs like plague calling love evil...
Sugar-covered all throughout the bible.
I'm going to be a better man I got a bible...
Man Science proves you're the one who actually sold his soul.
Now you're sexist, homophobic, and biologically loveless.

I think I can think without a bible just fine...
I'm not going to give up my love...
It's all I have to live for...
Love itself.
