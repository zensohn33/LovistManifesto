# Israel

I don't support the death of jews, i'm trying to change their perspective of hate toward others in their judgement day into love and acceptance...
I wish for peace in Gaza to create what I call the conscious evolution of humanity through world peace. The next step in human evolution comes when all war ends.

1. Biological discrimination sourced from the bible
The inherent fact that we are all born to eat and make love, and that without science we cannot prove someone has sinned. We would have to measure someones diet to call them a glutton, and actually know their biological needs to tell whether something should be considered "too much" or a deadly sin. The same rules apply for judging sexuality...
since we cannot inherently measure another's needs we shouldn't be judging them to death in our minds for something science proves we are born to do to be healthy. Eating & making love both are proven to be healthy for the normal human being, and saying someone should "die in hell" for doing something as natural as eating or sex is considered discrimination against someone's inborn biological functions.
2. Jewish Racial Supremacy
If the beliefs you distribute religiously are inherently against the way the world functions naturally you should not be the "One True God" or leader of the world as a country. You believe the way 99% of the world functions is evil and should die in the rapture... I think Jewish DNA was born to survive a desert and they are confused into thinking calling everyone sinners is a loving thing to do... When really it is hateful. But they needed this to survive a desert and I forgive their DNA for thinking the sins of others are failed survival attempts in the desert... Truly lonely the life of a jew, definitely lonely being born different than everyone else. I actually think they're just misunderstood and I hope the war in Gaza stops.
3. Religious Sexism
Thinking women are inferior and all sinners, is biologically proven to be against peace.
Psychology proves love and understanding comes from our mother, and to reject women to death (to hell) makes one violent. I believe this is largely the reason there is war in Israel for the past 14 centuries. The mother added to the holy trinity may save Israeli lives and I hope it does. My peaceful message to Israel, and I hope the war stops in Israel.
4. Religious Segregation from One True God
The notion of One True God forces people to reject others as unworthy of love if they aren't from a religious background, and everyone is worthy of love...
The act of religious segregation is discriminatory and hateful, it divides the people.
All people are inherently born good, and for some reason most Christians don't believe this.
One True God makes them look down at others from a non-christian upbringing... All messages of love from other religions don't exist to a christian because of religious segregation from One "True" God.
5. Self Confirmation as hate
Saying everyone is a sinner and should die for something you can't provide proof of is evil and hateful. Since I constantly don't have to prove whether someone has sinned and it can be my own depiction of when you are wrong its only opinion, self confirmation via god is basically the equivalent of loaded dice and we use them to judge people. Since their is no margin of when someone has eaten too much, its easy to call someone a glutton.
Really the rule of gluttony was just made to help ration food in the desert and we actually have no idea when someone has eaten "too much" therefore sins can only be personal opinion not a verifiable fact.
We'd have to someone's measure Body Mass Index to tell if someone has eaten too much, and only a doctor can do this.
So telling someone to die in hell for a eating more than our opinion of what is healthy is wrong...
And an important example of how we shouldn't judge others because we don't know what their body needs specifically.
6. Christ is hateful
Since Christ causes others to judge and discriminate against people as "sinners" for their natural survival instincts (which is biological discrimination) I think Christ is hateful. I see myself as a loving person that accepts all walks of life (even jews), and I would urge people to give up christ's hateful judgement in exchange for love & acceptance.
