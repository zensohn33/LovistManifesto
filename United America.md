# United America

The insanity of the American political process reveals a mind numbing expanse of wasted time and efforts...
Every 4 years the topics are the same, gun control & abortion.
Every 4 years the answers change only temporarily.

Then back to the way they were in another 4 years.

We waste our lives away on this insanity!

Is your average American voter insane or are they secretly against progress?
Is the public unconscious at large?
Is the bipartisan system against democratic ideals that incentivize progress?

The socialist revolution ended the bipartisan system in the long run, an America divided is no America at all. I believe that a divided democracy is against the purpose of a democracy in the first place, which is supposed to unite the people under a shared consensus.
Not a tug of war that causes complete disagreement amongst Americans constantly.
The divided ways of a bipartisan party system completely rejects political progress of the ever changing America that seeks to be United. Stagnancy and bickering at best, riots at the worst. We needed something we could all count on, a stable progressive America.
The burnt rubber smell of Hollywood eventually worked its way out of Nevada, out of the movies, out of advertising. The people started to know why they believe something, and began to feel it for all its worth.
A new time in the World where America is United in Democracy...
Where America finally owns itself.
Not a capitalist America,
A Socialist America.

A classism free utopia leading the world in Equality.

P.S.
The irony of the bipartisan Divide in a place titled "United" States Of America was never lost on me, can you say Civil War?
