# The Bible & Anti-Humanism

The Bible inherently teaches people to hate others for instincts that they all have inborn to help them survive, and feel fulfilled in life.
Here's proof of the biological anti-humanism...

The Bible, authored by people from a desert environment, reflects certain biological survival adaptations. This "desert mindset" led to the global rejection of things all humans consider essential for survival. 

While food and sex are vital for life, the Bible categorizes Gluttony and Lust as Deadly Sins… That means God will kill you for wanting to Eat or have Sex “too much”.

But the margins of what too much is, conveniently aren’t defined.

Which means if you are thought to have sinned you're judged without proof of it being enough to qualify as a sin.

Contrary to the fact 99% of the world's populations bodies are made to crave Food & Sex to survive.

 Then this is proof that Jews inherently biologically discriminate against what it means to be a normal human being…

You get called a sinner for doing something that's considered the within the basic needs of a human.

This means 99% of the worlds inhabitants are going to get sociopathically judged and killed in the rapture in the minds of most Christians for doing something we have born inside our DNA to do to survive... 

To eat and to make love.

This is biological discrimination, straight from the Bible.

To realize the limitations of the way we're made to live from our DNA is something the Bible cannot do yet.

It currently says most biological functions of a regular human being are "sins."

I really think Israel needs to find a way to integrate with the rest of the world without judging it as sinful, and to create a Bible that doesn't cause so much Old Testament hate.

The desert DNA is an anomaly that is obviously born to disagree with 99% of the world's natural inclinations, and has sociopathic apocalyptic fantasies about killing off all those that sin in their mind,

and not even for quantifiable sins.

They are all sent to death in the rapture. When science can prove we all need to eat & make love and these are basic needs according to psychology.

This means desert DNA is inherently born hateful against humans with natural inclinations to survive on earth… 

They think the sinners they are persecuting should die in their mind as many times as they think of attempting to survive on earth.
These are sociopathic self confirming tendencies, that lead toward covert narcissism.

If these behaviors are the fueling the minds of Christians, I believe their beliefs are an act of anti-humanism due to their beliefs being against the natural biological needs of humanity. Also considering they have killed those not in line with their beliefs this makes me wonder what they think of me in silence…

Judging everyone to the point of death is by no means loving or Christ like whatsoever...
If everyone knew the way Christianity functions, rather than the way it looks it would have no followers, lost in a daydream thinking they love everyone whilst most days they pray others to death for all their mistakes.
This illusion maintains the religion alone.

A sad truth of the world is that the desert DNA was made to survive conditions others could not by abstaining, and it inherently teaches others en masse to hate others for what would be considered normal survival instincts for 99% of the human race, that is anti-humanism.

These are the effects of racial supremacy from the believers in one true god who is thought to be held above everyone else's natural biological inclinations to survive.
Realize the limitations of everyone's biology and be diverse in your acceptance of all lives globally, Israel...
Or else the world will never be one.
The Bible doesn't tolerate the realities of human existence yet...
Either the world was born wrong, or Israel was born to be judgemental of the natural human condition.

I'd retract your judgment day from the world and realize maybe you're made to be the world's savior after you stopped judging the way we're all born...

I'm not “weak in the flesh” as they say.

You just think it's wrong to be human…

And now you think it's cool to teach people to be against normal human behavior.
Maybe you can be the savior of the world, once you know how to love the world's racial biology as it is.

Love comes first Israel, remember that...
not judgment day.
