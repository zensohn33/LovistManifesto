# Religious Segregation

Religious Segregation is the discriminative act of not talking to someone because they won’t adopt the same beliefs as you… 

An indicator of narcissism/intolerance as well.

Silent conscious discrimination happens against the supposed inferior people that don’t have religious beliefs in line with 

One “True” God.

Never learn the divide that makes you feel like you're worth more than anyone else. 

That's the deeper realization.
Never look down at someone from something that is supposed to save them...
Never partake in religious segregation.

Religion hurts people worldwide from this rejection, and only now do more mention its inherent discrimination and judgement.
The source of religious segregation is One True God and the notion of converting those outside your beliefs to your own.
Nobody needs to be segregated or deemed lesser, all humanity is inherently good at heart.
Stand up today against the fake love of religious segregation.

"Real love is acceptance, not god's judgement.”
