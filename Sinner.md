# Sinner

The inversion of good & evil takes place in the original sin, where our anima (eve), is rejected to death as the sinful one in the garden of eden. The whole of the bible is about the pursuit of these virtues, all the while a sleight of hand is occurring.
Love is being deemed a sin by the original sin, and to be righteous and avoid sin, is the continuing premise of being "good" in the bible.
The truest cause of antisemitism, is this trick... from what was good into "evil"

The psychological effects of being loveless are caused by death ideation (perceiving sin) toward women.
People were called racist for intuitively picking up on this rejection of love via sexismâ€¦ regular day to day life that is healthy as any psychologist can tell you.

90% of the way we live normally was deemed as "evil", and the church stood there judging everyone with their judgement day...
The fuel for the witch trials, and the crusades.
Some people thought that these angels were actually devils... if you trace the psychological effects of the story of the original sin you'll find this is true.

Proof reality needs inspection to be understood in time...
History proves that judging books by their "Angelic" racial supremacist looks...
Will deceive you.

Selling your soul to the devil, actually has it's subconscious roots in expressing love for others.
The church says loving others biologically is evil.
They say love is a sin.

This makes God evil.
Judgement day is hateful, and the bible revolves around it.
Science is the only way to save billions, not hateful judgement of "sinners".

Love is considered a sin, and I don't believe in a life without love, so as a Neo Aryan, I say love is not evil.
If to love is to sin, then I am a sinner.
If I was born good then maybe when the tables turn you'll realize how your ego has deceived you into thinking you're good.
Unlike Christians I believe in the inherent good of humanity.
People don't need saving.
They need Love.
It's being accepted that is the real love that saves lives.
Not being judged by god.
Your Devils are in my details ;)
