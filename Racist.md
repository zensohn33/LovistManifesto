# Racist

If a race/bible gets people to believe in a discriminatory and judgmental fashion toward others, I don't believe it deserves to be looked down at as a form of "racism," which is just a counter buzz word that hides the well-known religious homophobia, little-known religious sexism ("All women are depicted as sinners that should die in hell because all women are tainted sinners"), and the judgmental attitude that basing your life around judgment day brings.

If I'm "racist" against someone who is discriminatory, then isn't that just fighting discrimination?

They discriminate and judge others as a way of life... Then pull the race card to get out of it...

The homophobia, sexism, and judgmental sentiment. If someone's race as a whole is discriminatory and judgmental, then the term racism should not stand because it is just to stand against religious sexism, religious homophobia, and their narcissistic judgment...

Taking away someone's reproductive rights shows the secret domineering attitude that the bible leaves you with...

It's not your lifeâ€”hands off of it...

This is what a classist racial supremacist does...

I guess being against
religious sexism,
religious homophobia,
and a judgmental attitude is "racist."

It's not racism, it's a just cause against discrimination sourced from a supremacist "race."
