# Authenticity

Religion can rob the world of its authenticity, and thereby its happiness.
See every second we experience our dreams we are able to be authentic to the self.
Without this the world is made of constrained smiles and fake laughter, with a lost sense of purpose.
Without being true to yourself you have nothing, and this is the religious process...

Living a lie day in and day out is what the absence of authenticity is, and organized religion wants it for the world...
To rob us of our purpose, our sense of direction, and awe in the worlds ups and downs.
All things being true to the self, is what being authentic provides the people.
Should you be fake?
Or is being real an enjoyable existence you deserve to live?

Christ strives to be the truth, yet his practice makes us liars to all...

Why would we want a society full of nice liars?
I want the world to live to it's fullest sense of purpose and knowingness in itself...
And Authenticity to our true selves is the only way there.
Know thyself.
