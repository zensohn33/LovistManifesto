# All Lives Matter

The reason I say All Lives Matter is that I believe Jews should be treated as equals, so long as they aren't Racial or Religious Supremacists that have disregarded all lives thoughts besides the ones that follow their own beliefs, as an act of religious segregation from One True God.

I don't use this phrase naively, I believe all people can be good, and blanket statements like "Anti-Semitism" insinuate they're all bad, and statistically this just isn't true.
Everyone deserves a chance to be good, and shouldn't be spoken badly of unless they are actually guilty. Some Jews are gay, some aren't religious supremacists...
Some don't care about the politics.
Anyone has a chance to be good, so to clarify...
All Lives *can* Matter, when they respect the beliefs of All Lives.

One "True" God simply doesn't respect other ways of life and the diversity of their beliefs.
Religious Supremacy and Racial Supremacy hurts all races!
Nobody is better than anyone else just because they're born of a certain race!
All Lives Matter!
